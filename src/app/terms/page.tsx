          The App is intended for internal use within an organizational
          environment to manage attendance records, process uploaded reports,
          maintain work logs, and generate attendance documentation.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Data Accuracy</h2>
        <p>

          developer, unless explicitly transferred or licensed through a
          separate written agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any evaluation, use, or deployment of the system by the company shall
          be subject to mutually agreed terms.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          The App is provided as an internal productivity tool by the developer.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms may be updated periodically. Continued use of the App
