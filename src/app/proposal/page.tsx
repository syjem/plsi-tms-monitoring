        Time Management System (TMS) Employee Monitoring — Proposal
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-8 text-lg text-muted-foreground">
        Automating attendance reporting, work logs, and signatures — every
        cut-off, without the manual hassle.
      </p>

      {/* Introduction */}
      <section className="mb-10 space-y-4">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Background</h2>
        <p>
          Every cut-off period, employees are required to manually transfer data
          from official attendance records into monitoring or attendance sheets.
          This process is repetitive, and time-consuming.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Time Management System (TMS) Employee Monitoring was built to
          eliminate this manual work by automating data extraction, work log
          generation, and document preparation — while still allowing full user
          control.

      <section className="mb-10 space-y-4">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">The Problem</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>
            Manual copying of time-in, breaks, and time-out data every cut-off
          </li>
          <li>
            Rewriting the same information across multiple rows and documents
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeatedly drawing or signing signatures per row or per document
          </li>
          <li>Higher chance of mistakes due to fatigue and repetition</li>
          <li>Time spent on admin work instead of productive tasks</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>
          The TMS Monitoring system provides a centralized, secure web
          application that automates the most tedious parts of attendance
          reporting.

          <li>
            Auto-generate work logs that can still be reviewed and edited by
            users
          </li>
          <li>
            Capture a digital signature once and reuse it across future
            documents
          </li>
          <li>Generate clean, readable, and printable attendance sheets</li>
          <li>
            Secure user authentication ensures data is private and controlled

        <p>
          To ensure transparency, the following limitations are important to
          note:
        </p>

        <ol className="list-decimal space-y-3 pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>PDF Data Visibility</strong>
            <br />
            Attendance records are extracted exactly as they appear in the
            official company-generated PDF. Any records or logs that are hidden,
            omitted, or not shown in the PDF must be manually added by the user
            during the editing step before saving and printing.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>AI Extraction Service Availability</strong>
            <br />
            The system uses the free-tier Gemini AI service for PDF data
            extraction. In cases where the service is temporarily unavailable
            (e.g., rate limits, service outages, or 503 errors), users may need
            to wait until the service becomes available again.

      {/* Security */}
      <section className="mb-10 space-y-4">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Security and Access</h2>
        <p>
          Access to the system is restricted to authenticated users only. All
          data is stored securely, and the application is intended strictly for
          internal company use.

          The Time Management System (TMS) Employee Monitoring is a practical
          tool designed to improve efficiency, accuracy, and readability of
          attendance reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
          By automating repetitive tasks while preserving user control, the
          system helps employees focus on meaningful work — and makes attendance
          review easier for everyone involved.
