# Employee Time Management System (TMS) Monitoring

## Overview

The Employee Time Management System (TMS) Monitoring is an independently
developed web application designed to assist with employee attendance
tracking and time management within an organizational environment.

It automates the process of preparing attendance sheets by extracting
data from uploaded PDF reports, while also providing full CRUD operations
for work logs, digital signature management, and secure user
authentication.

Instead of manually writing time-in, breaks, time-out, destinations,
and remarks from Daily Time Records every 15-day cut-off period, users
can upload a PDF attendance report and have the data automatically
extracted, reviewed, and formatted into clean, printable documents.

The system also allows users to capture and reuse digital signatures,
ensuring consistency across documents and reducing repetitive work.

## Why This Was Built

Every cut-off period, employees (including the author) were required to
manually transfer attendance data from official attendance records into
monitoring or attendance sheets. This process was repetitive,
time-consuming, and prone to errors.

This project was built to eliminate that manual workload by automating
data extraction and document preparation, while still allowing users to
review and adjust records before final submission.
