# Todo Lists

1. Remove Dark Mode in the app for consistent signature colors
2. Set signatories
   - Add client-side checks (e.g., required fields)
   - Handle cases where the profile doesn't exist (create it first if needed)
3. `src/app/actions/logs` Use drizzle's `db` instance instead of Supabase default queries
   - Add a new controller for logs
4. Google Sign-in/Sign-up branding
